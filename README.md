# Covid-19 Predictions using Time Series Data

This project generated global time series forecast data of the COVID-19 pandemic

A publicly available real-time Covid-19 dataset was used. 

a) Sklearn models were used to carry out regression

b) Support Vector Machine to forecast future predictions

c) Dataset insights were represented with the help of graphs using Matplotlib. 


A model was finally created to give a predictions of;
