# Covid-19 Predictions using Time Series Data

This project generated global time series forecast data of the COVID-19 pandemic

A publicly available real-time Covid-19 dataset was used (https://github.com/datasets/covid-19/tree/main/data)

a) Dataset insights were represented with the help of graphs using Matplotlib

b) Support Vector Machine and Sklearn models were used to carry out predictions using regression analysis

A model was finally created to give a predictions of; 

#### 1) Covid-19 cases 

#### 2) Covid-19 deaths
#### 3) Covid-19 recoveries
